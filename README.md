Created an app with React Native about Valorant Video Game using an unofficial API.

The purpose of making this app is improving my React Navigation skills and learning about Material Top Tabs Navigator by using it first time.

API URL: https://valorant-api.com/

I didn't really use the features of the API because my main goal was to learn about top tabs.
